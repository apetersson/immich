### Nominatim Service Refactoring and New HybridReverseGeocodeService

**Date:** August 20, 2025

**Summary of Changes:**

*   **`nominatim.service.ts` Modification:**
    *   Changed the Nominatim API request format from XML to JSON.
    *   Removed the `xml2js` dependency and associated XML parsing logic.
    *   Updated the URL to include `format=json`.
    *   Adjusted the parsing and access of the response object to align with the new JSON structure.

*   **`HybridReverseGeocodeService` Creation:**
    *   Created a new service file: `server/src/services/hybrid-reverse-geocode.service.ts`.
    *   The service was initialized with two dependencies: `MapRepository` and `NominatimService`.
    *   Ensured proper initialization by adding `HybridReverseGeocodeService` to the `services` array in `server/src/services/index.ts`.
    *   Corrected import paths within `HybridReverseGeocodeService` from relative to absolute to adhere to project linting rules.

**Verification:**

*   All `pnpm lint` checks passed after modifications.
*   The project successfully built (`pnpm build`) without compilation errors.

## Docker Environment for Verification

To perform `pnpm` commands and verify changes within the Immich project, a specific Docker environment setup was utilized due to the project's structure and the need to execute commands within the running `immich_server` container.

**Command Structure:**

`docker exec -w /workspaces/immich/server immich_server pnpm --filter immich <command>`

**Explanation:**

*   **`docker exec immich_server`**: This part of the command executes a command inside the running Docker container named `immich_server`. This is necessary because the `pnpm` commands, build tools, and dependencies are installed and configured within the container's environment.

*   **`-w /workspaces/immich/server`**: The `-w` flag sets the working directory *inside* the Docker container. The Immich project's `server` workspace is located at `/workspaces/immich/server` within the container. Specifying this ensures that `pnpm` commands are executed in the correct context, allowing them to find the `package.json` and `node_modules` relevant to the server application.

*   **`pnpm --filter immich`**: This flag was used to optimize `pnpm` commands. The Immich project's `server` directory is part of a monorepo, and `--filter immich` tells `pnpm` to only operate on the `immich` workspace (which corresponds to the `server` directory in this context), significantly speeding up operations like `install`, `lint`, and `build` by avoiding unnecessary processing of other workspaces.

This setup allowed for accurate and efficient verification of code changes and compilation within the intended runtime environment.

### Backend Container Startup

The backend container (`immich_server`) was started using the following sequence of commands:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml -f .devcontainer/server/container-compose-overrides.yml down
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml -f .devcontainer/server/container-compose-overrides.yml build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml -f .devcontainer/server/container-compose-overrides.yml up -d
docker exec -it immich_server bash -c "/immich-devcontainer/container-start-backend.sh"
```
